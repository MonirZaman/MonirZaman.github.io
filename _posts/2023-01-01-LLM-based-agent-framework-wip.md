# Exploring the Dynamics of Multi-Agent Frameworks: An Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, multi-agent frameworks stand at the forefront of innovation, driving systems that are more robust, adaptable, and intelligent. These frameworks represent a paradigm shift from solitary computational entities to a collective of agents, each with unique capabilities and roles, working in concert to solve complex problems.

At its core, a multi-agent framework is a system composed of multiple interacting intelligent agents. 

- Large Language Models (LLMs): These are the core of the agents’ intelligence, enabling them to understand and generate human language. They act as the reasoning engine for the agents, allowing them to process complex data and queries to produce coherent responses1.

- Agents: These are autonomous entities within the framework, each designed to perform specific tasks and make decisions. They work collaboratively towards a shared goal, using LLMs to facilitate advanced decision-making and task execution1.

- Tools: These are specialized functions or skills that agents use to carry out their tasks. They can range from simple data retrieval to more complex analytical functions, forming the operational backbone of the agents1.

- Processes or Flows: These define the orchestration of tasks within the system, ensuring that tasks are distributed efficiently and aligned with the framework’s objectives. They guide both the interactions between agents and the use of tools to achieve the desired outcomes

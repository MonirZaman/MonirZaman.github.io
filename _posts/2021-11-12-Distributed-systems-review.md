This post will review a distributed system's research paper:
### Millions of Tiny Databases by Brooker et al.

The paper describes a distributed system called Physalia which is defined by the following properties.
- Distributed database
- Offers strong durability and consistency
- Consists of cell where each cell consists of 7 nodes
- Compute instance e.g., EC2 is Client that uses Physalia to pinpoint where blocks of a file are stored. Following is an image showing a block storage connected to a compute instance.

## Paxos-based distributed state machine
- Each Physalia installation is a colony, made up of many cells
- Each cell manages the data of a single partition key
- Cell is implemented using a distributed state machine, distributed across seven nodes
- A cell is a single Paxos-based distributed state machine, with one of the nodes playing the role of distinguished proposer.
- Dividing colony into cells helps to reduce blast radius or minimize the impact of network partition.
- A node may participate in more than one cells and each cell will have many nodes.
- Each node should contain a different mix of cells, which reduces the chance of correlated failure due to load or other reasons.

**Paxos** algorithm overview:  
This is algorithm is used by nodes in a distributed system to reach consensus on a single value. This value is later used to manage the distributed system. Goal of the system is to offer safety and liveness. I will provide a short overview of the Paxos algorithm based on the original paper:

Leslie Lamport. 2001. Paxos made simple. ACM SIGACT News 32, 4 (Dec. 2001), 51â€“58.
```

- There are two types of node: Proposer and Acceptor
- [1] A proposer first sends a prepare message with a proposal value n
- [2] When an acceptor receives a message with n, it compares n with any of the proposals it received in the past. If n is the greatest, it sends a response promising that it won't accept any proposal with value lower than n and with the highest-numbered proposal (if any) that it has accepted. 
- [3] When the proposer receives response for its request message from a majority of the acceptors, it sends an accept request to each of the acceptor containing n and v where v is where v is the value of the highest-numbered proposal among the responses, or is any value if the responses reported no proposals.  
- [4] When an acceptor receives an accept request, it accepts the proposal numbered as n, except it has already responded to another prepare request with number greater than n.



## Novel contribution in availability
- Address availability of the database in a unique way by
  utilizing the following information 
  - Network topology 
  - Location of the client
  - Data center power and networking



## CAP theorem
- Primary focus is Strong consistency to ensure correctness of the storage replication protocol
- Secondary focus is availablity. It ensures Physalia is available during network partition.

* [Make boats fly](https://neurips.cc/ExpoConferences/2020/talk%20panel/21297)
- Optimize folds to laptime
- Use simulator to optimize design choices
- Objective is to evaluate as many design choices as possible
- Boats have more inputs than f1 cars
- Use RL to optimize the design choices
- Boat simulator: loosely defined goal, imperfect knowledge of the environment and complex dynamics
- RL controls 14 inputs. Optimizes the velocity made good.
    - Autopilot/RL trained agent follow the path and perform manuevers
    - Curriculumn learning, custom initialization, sharing experience replay buffer across workers, domain randomization, sample efficient, recovering spot instances
    - Autopilot/RL evaluates a design
    - Genetic search like method to search optimal design choices
    - Removes uncertainty of human input. No need to perfom many lapse and average output

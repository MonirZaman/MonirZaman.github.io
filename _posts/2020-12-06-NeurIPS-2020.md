* [Make boats fly](https://neurips.cc/ExpoConferences/2020/talk%20panel/21297)
- Optimize folds to laptime
- Use simulator to optimize design choices
- Objective is to evaluate as many design choices as possible
- Boats have more inputs than f1 cars
- Use RL to optimize the design choices
- Boat simulator: loosely defined goal, imperfect knowledge of the environment and complex dynamics
- RL controls 14 inputs. Optimizes the velocity made good.
    - Autopilot/RL trained agent follow the path and perform manuevers
    - Curriculumn learning, custom initialization, sharing experience replay buffer across workers, domain randomization, sample efficient, recovering spot instances, use different seeds
    - Encapsulate a simulator in gym environment
    - Rewards
    - Autopilot/RL evaluates a design
    - Genetic search like method to search optimal design choices
    - Removes uncertainty of human input. No need to perfom many lapse and average output

* [The Challenges and Latest Advances in Causal AI](https://slideslive.com/38942298/the-challenges-and-latest-advances-in-causal-ai)
    - causal model helps to adapt data drift in dynamic world
    -  It helps to discover causal driver and avoid spurious correlation
    - Works with small data
    - causalLens is an ML library that helps users to build causal model
    - Reading list:
        - Beyond structural causal models: causal constraints models by Blom et al. 2019
        - Necessary and sufficient conditions for causal feature selection in time series by Mastakouri et al. 2020
        - DYNOTEARS structural learning from time series data by Pamfil et al 2020

* [MINING AND LEARNING WITH GRAPHS AT SCALE](https://neurips.cc/ExpoConferences/2020/workshop/20237)
- Tell us about our data:  Local data to Global data
- Computation on Multi-modal data
- Scaling
- Widely used features: graph building and clustering, semi-supervised learning, GNNs and embedding

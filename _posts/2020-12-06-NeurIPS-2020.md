# NeurIPS 2020

## Day 2

* [Human evaluation for ML models]
* Generative conversational AI
    - Perplexity, BLEU
    - Human evaluation Likert (Humanness, coherence, fluency)
    - Human A/B test like interaction
    - Vanilla Seq-to-Seq model: Lack of diversity, inconsistency, lack of knowledge, lack of empathy
    - Ways to address:
    - Deeper conversation 
    - Add diversity: Nucleus sampling
    - Personalization: embedding
    - Knowledge graph

* [Forget About the LiDAR: Self-Supervised Depth Estimators with MED Probability Volumes](https://slideslive.com/38942458/forget-about-the-lidar-selfsupervised-depth-estimators-with-med-probability-volumes)
    - State of the art SIDE can be achieved by autoencoder network incorporating MED representations in the output layer
    - Outperforms DORN supervised baseline

* [Make boats fly](https://neurips.cc/ExpoConferences/2020/talk%20panel/21297)
- Optimize folds to laptime
- Use simulator to optimize design choices
- Objective is to evaluate as many design choices as possible
- Boats have more inputs than f1 cars
- Use RL to optimize the design choices
- Boat simulator: loosely defined goal, imperfect knowledge of the environment and complex dynamics
- RL controls 14 inputs. Optimizes the velocity made good.
    - Autopilot/RL trained agent follow the path and perform manuevers
    - Curriculumn learning, custom initialization, sharing experience replay buffer across workers, domain randomization, sample efficient, recovering spot instances, use different seeds
    - Encapsulate a simulator in gym environment
    - Rewards
    - Autopilot/RL evaluates a design
    - Genetic search like method to search optimal design choices
    - Removes uncertainty of human input. No need to perfom many lapse and average output

* [The Challenges and Latest Advances in Causal AI](https://slideslive.com/38942298/the-challenges-and-latest-advances-in-causal-ai)
    - causal model helps to adapt data drift in dynamic world
    -  It helps to discover causal driver and avoid spurious correlation
    - Works with small data
    - causalLens is an ML library that helps users to build causal model
    - Reading list:
        - Beyond structural causal models: causal constraints models by Blom et al. 2019
        - Necessary and sufficient conditions for causal feature selection in time series by Mastakouri et al. 2020
        - DYNOTEARS structural learning from time series data by Pamfil et al 2020

* [MINING AND LEARNING WITH GRAPHS AT SCALE](https://neurips.cc/ExpoConferences/2020/workshop/20237)
- Tell us about our data:  Local data to Global data
- Computation on Multi-modal data
- Scaling: mapreduce, distributed hashtable, GraphTensor for tensorflow, jraph 
- Widely used features: graph building and clustering, semi-supervised learning, GNNs and embedding
- Graph building: LSH, semisupervised, local search and auto-encoders.
- Clustering
- Information propagation
- Signals and topological analysis

GNN and COVID-19
- Spatial and temporal information was used to model COVID-19 spread
- Graph used spatial information to build the graph. One graph is built for each day. A graph receives information from the previous day's graph.
- Model predicts case count

Graphs for privacy
- Federated learning of cohorts
- Cluster of k users. Users within a cluster bear similarity in browser behavior
- Affinity hierarchical clustering algorithm

Causal inference
- Random trial
- Clustering: group nodes that are in control group and treatment group
- Correlation clusterings beat balanced clustering

[Grale: Building graph at scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12002.pdf)
- Semi-supervised learning and inference on the unlabeled nodes
- Different types of relationship. Finding the right relationship is important
- Multi-modal features
- Bucket using LSH. Within each bucket, training data (whether two node belong to the same graph) and build graph
- Grale at Youtube to find malicious actor
    - Abusive vs non-abuse item

Clustering at scale
- Affinity Hierarchical clustering
- MapReduce 
- Randomized Composable Core-sets

# LangChain: Q&A over Documents

An example might be a tool that would allow you to query a product catalog for items of interest.


```python
#pip install --upgrade langchain
```


```python
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv()) # read local .env file
```


```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.document_loaders import CSVLoader
from langchain.vectorstores import DocArrayInMemorySearch
from IPython.display import display, Markdown
```


```python
file = 'OutdoorClothingCatalog_1000.csv'
loader = CSVLoader(file_path=file)
```


```python
from langchain.indexes import VectorstoreIndexCreator
```


```python
#pip install docarray
help(loader)

```

    Help on CSVLoader in module langchain.document_loaders.csv_loader object:
    
    class CSVLoader(langchain.document_loaders.base.BaseLoader)
     |  CSVLoader(file_path: str, source_column: Optional[str] = None, csv_args: Optional[Dict] = None, encoding: Optional[str] = None)
     |  
     |  Loads a CSV file into a list of documents.
     |  
     |  Each document represents one row of the CSV file. Every row is converted into a
     |  key/value pair and outputted to a new line in the document's page_content.
     |  
     |  The source for each document loaded from csv is set to the value of the
     |  `file_path` argument for all doucments by default.
     |  You can override this by setting the `source_column` argument to the
     |  name of a column in the CSV file.
     |  The source of each document will then be set to the value of the column
     |  with the name specified in `source_column`.
     |  
     |  Output Example:
     |      .. code-block:: txt
     |  
     |          column1: value1
     |          column2: value2
     |          column3: value3

Authors propose to address catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks. Tasks interfere with each other.
When such forgetting appear
1. Correlated inputs
2. Dense input

They propose to create task representation. They propose a 
separate prediction model. These two steps in combination constitute a learning model that is able to generalize over multiple tasks.

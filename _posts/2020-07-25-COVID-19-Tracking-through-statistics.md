I have done some analysis on COVID-19 and its related datasets, with Bangladesh as a casestudy.
You can read the findings of the study in this [blog](https://sohojai.github.io/covid19/) written in Bengali.  

[COVID-19 $$R_{t}$$ Calculation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sohojai/covid19/blob/master/_notebooks/Bangladesh_Covid19_Rt.ipynb).  
Effective reproduction rate $$R_{t}$$ is an important statistics that informs us of how many people will get the virus from one infected person. I have applied Kevin Systrom's [model](https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R0.ipynb) and tuned it to calculate $$R_{t}$$ for Bangladesh. Notebook can be accessed from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sohojai/covid19/blob/master/_notebooks/Bangladesh_Covid19_Rt.ipynb).  

[Facebook Mobility Dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/movement-range-maps)  
The dataset includes movement changes measured by Facebook from users' wifi usage throughout March, April, and May 2020 starting from a baseline in February. My EDA notebook exploring this data is [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sohojai/covid19/blob/master/_notebooks/Fb-Mobility-Data-Analysis.ipynb).
